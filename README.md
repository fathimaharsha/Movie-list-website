# Movie-list-website
Here is the link to checkout the website : http://movielistapp.pythonanywhere.com/
<ul><li>This is a website where we can list movies with their details. Its like a very basic version of the movie listing websites.</li><li> We can see whichever movies are displayed, or we can add movies to the list or update them with new details. Or else simply remove them from the list.</li>
<li>This website is created using python with Django framework. I used MVT architecture as the design pattern and I created the template by myself. </li>
